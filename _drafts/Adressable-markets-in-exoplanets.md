Many scientists will probably scoff at the idea of capitalism in the academic world. But I like to think that there is a more fundamental level of economics involved the knowledge production, almost like a trade market. Why am I doing this analogy? Alright, maybe I am bored, but it could be useful to help us shape strategies to maximize the impact of our work, and maybe minimize frustrations.

Let's start with two fundamental concepts that compose a trade market: actors and commodities. In real-world trade, actors are customers, clients, traders, producers, etc. Commodities are the products, services and currency. What would these be in the world of knowledge exchange? A naive analogy could assume that scientists are the actors selling and buying knowledge, and the commodities could be publications, which is what scientists produce. But this analogy quickly breaks down when we realize that, actually, scientists are not really in the market to buy publications. I think a much better analogy is that *publications are the actors*, and the commodities are **data**, **ideas**, **time**, and **citations**. Yes, citations. Publications (the actors) pay each other with citations (currency) for their intellectual contributions (product). In this analogy, the economics of knowledge production is completely agnostic to those who actually produce knowledge. And at the end I will point out why it is a terrible idea to completely remove scientists from this equation.



Now, if you entertain me for a while
