I am a PhD candidate at the Geneva Observatory, where I work with [David Ehrenreich](https://obswww.unige.ch/~ehrenrei/homepage/Welcome.html) and many other scientists. I am also a member of the [NCCR PlanetS](http://nccr-planets.ch) collaboration. My pronouns are he/him/his.

My main research topic is the detection and characterization of extra-solar planets, more specifically their upper atmospheres. I am also interested in solving problems related to the observation and description of stellar atmospheres and developing scientific software for the astronomical community. The main instruments I use in my research are high-resolution and/or space-based spectrographs. You can watch a [talk I gave at the 5th NUVA Workshop](https://exoplanet-talks.org/talk/261) on my research topic.

Occasionally I [write software](https://github.com/ladsantos) in Python and scripts for astronomical research. Here are some that I think could be useful for you:

* [`p-winds`](https://p-winds.readthedocs.io/): Isothermal Parker wind models for upper atmospheres of planets. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/ladsantos/p-winds/pulls) or [submit issues](https://github.com/ladsantos/p-winds/issues) on GitHub!

* [`sunburn`](https://github.com/ladsantos/sunburn): Data analysis package of HST far-UV spectra.

* [`radial`](https://github.com/ladsantos/radial): Pure Python code for working with radial velocities of stars with a companion (checkout the tutorial notebooks [here](https://github.com/ladsantos/RV_PS2017)).

* [`onza`](https://github.com/ladsantos/onza): Exospheres in transmission spectroscopy.

Some useful book-keeping resources for exoplanet science:

* List of exoplanets that have had their atmospheres probed in transmission and published: [exoplanet_transmission_list.txt](https://gist.github.com/ladsantos/33188da3be28941a2224cd7780445ec1). My plan is to make this an exhaustive list, so if you know of an exoplanet that is not listed in there, drop me a comment.

* [Non-exhaustive archive of exoplanet transmission spectra](https://stellarplanet.org/science/exoplanet-transmission-spectra/) (maintained by H. Wakeford)

* [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu)
